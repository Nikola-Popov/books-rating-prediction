# Training a prediction model for the average rating of a book
---
### Motivation
This project will serve as an item based recommendation system for the average rating of a book. Thus no new user preferences will be taken into account. We will solely rely on the already rated books.

### Data source
The dataset is a sample from Goodreads.com and is published at: https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks
